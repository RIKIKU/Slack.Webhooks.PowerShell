# Slack.Webhooks.PowerShell
A PowerShell Module built on the Slack.Webhooks library

I built this mainly to learn a bit of C# and to learn how to build compiled modules. There is already a good Slack Module that should do everything this one does called PSSlack so unless something changes I won't be publishing this.
